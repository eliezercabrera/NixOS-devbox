# NixOS-devbox

The .nix files for my NixOS instance on Linode. That I migrated to Arch Linux.

I still love NixOS conceptually. And > 90% of what I, or most people, want to do is easy to accomplish.

The remainding 10% will vary by person. In my case was adding a particular font to Tex live for displaying Japanese documents using upLaTeX. The process feels like a hack in regular distros (basically, copy the fonts into particular directories in /usr/share/).

This type of configuration should be reproducible in NixOS, but it is necessary to grasp and learn the .nix language to do so. At this moment, I am not willing to put the effort to do so for my mostly recreational endeavors.

The documentation is also unfriendly. It is not necessarily lacking, but is not as accesible as, for example, the Ubuntu forums, or Arch Linux's wiki and forums. There probably is an in-depth manual that can help you, but there is no quick "how to do this particular thing" results when doing a Google search.
